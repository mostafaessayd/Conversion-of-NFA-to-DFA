# Conversion-of-NFA-to-DFA
This folder contains the algorithm for converting DFA to NFA using C language and the code includes two versions
- Code using linked list
- Code using arrays
# Input
- The first line contains a single integer nbrOfstate (1≤nbrOfstate≤9) — the number of states.
- The second line contains a single integer nbrOfInitialstate (0≤nbrOfInitialstate≤nbrOfState) — the number of initial state.
- The third line contains nbrOfInitialstate integers initialState (0 ≤ initialState ≤ nbrOfstate) — the initial state.
